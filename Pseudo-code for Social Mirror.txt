Variables: 
- have a variable for each image, and set each one's position off-screen initially, and then bring it on-screen whenever the mouse hits a certain mouseX position

Each photo will represent a stage in the person's life (early childhood (3-8 years of age), middle childhood (8-12 years), adolescence (13-19 years), early adulthood (20-40 years), middle adulthood (40-65 years), old age (66-death). 

Do a data transformation effect between the photos

function draw (){
Map the user's mouse movement
The horizontal movement of the mouse, changes the photo being displayed 
The horizontal movement of the mouse also leads to more and more distortion 
We should start with a clean baby photo and end with a distorted older person photo
}

If this is too hard to do just have it be a generative design, without human interaction.

Because we don't know the effects of social media in old age, maybe only have it go from early childhood to adulthood.

Use StyleGAN to create the image morph transition
