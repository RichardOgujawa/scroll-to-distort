For the Social post video by Ella, e went over the grading rubric and she said:
- We need a storyboard for the video
- She wants credit for all the videos and images (it is original content or not?)
- We need to change all the text to one font which she said will also fix the problem of making the text more readable. Use Adobe Spark to do this. 
- She recommended changing the title to something shorter, like '5 ways hurling and camogie differ'
